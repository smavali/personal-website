I am a PhD student at the [Saarbr√ºcken Graduate School of Copmputer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/) and [International Max Planck Research School on Trustworthy Computing](https://www.imprs-trust.mpg.de/). I am broadly interested in topics such as Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning Theory and Security.

From 2018 to 2022, I spent four amazing years at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), where I did my B.Sc in computer science. During my bachelors, I did internships at [SensInt](https://sensinttest.github.io/) and [HCI](https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/) labs.
In my free time, I engage in activities such as visiting the gym, listening into podcasts, and studying the German language.
